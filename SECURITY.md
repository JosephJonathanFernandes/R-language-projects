## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please do not open a public issue. Instead, email the maintainers with a description of the problem and steps to reproduce. We will respond as quickly as possible and coordinate a fix.

Please include:

- Affected files or components
- Reproduction steps and impact
- Any suggested mitigations

We appreciate responsible disclosure.
